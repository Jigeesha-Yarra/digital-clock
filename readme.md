Clocks are useful elements for any UI if used in a proper way. Clocks can be used on sites where time is the main concern like some booking sites or some apps showing arriving times of trains, buses, flights, etc.
We will learn to make a digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Approach
Create the webpage structure in HTML using a div tag containing dummy time of time format “HH:MM:SS”.
Style the page with CSS using elements and classes defined in HTML.
In JavaScript define a function showTime and render it every second using JavaScript setInterval() method.
Create a new instance of time using JavaScript new Date().
Convert it into string format and show the output.
